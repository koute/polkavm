PVMTestSuite DEFINITIONS ::= BEGIN

-- a 32-bit integer
U32 ::= INTEGER(0..4294967295)

-- an 8-bit integer (a byte)
U8 ::= INTEGER(0..255)

-- a blob of bytes at a given memory address
MemoryChunk ::= SEQUENCE OF SEQUENCE {
    address U32,
    contents SEQUENCE OF U8
}

Testcase ::= SEQUENCE {
    -- a unique identifier for the test
    name UTF8String,

    -- (the "ω" from the paper)
    -- the initial value of each of the 13 registers; these need to be set *before* the test program is executed
    initial-regs SEQUENCE (SIZE(13..13)) OF U32,

    -- (the "ı" from the paper)
    -- the initial program counter from which to start the execution
    initial-pc U32,

    -- (part of the "µ" from the paper)
    -- lists regions of memory which should be accessible, initialized with zeros by default; any address not on this list should be inaccessible
    initial-page-map SEQUENCE OF SEQUENCE {
        address U32,
        length U32,
        is-writable BOOLEAN
    },

    -- (part of the "µ" from the paper)
    -- lists all non-zero values to put in memory before execution
    initial-memory MemoryChunk,

    -- (the bold "p" from the paper)
    -- the program blob to be executed as part of the test
    code SEQUENCE OF U8,

    -- (the "ζ" from the paper)
    -- the status code of the execution, i.e. the way the program is supposed to end
    expected-status ENUMERATED {
        -- (called "panic" in the Graypaper)
        -- the execution ended with a trap (the `trap` instruction was executed, the execution went "out of bounds", an invalid jump was made, or an invalid instruction was executed)
        trap,

        -- the execution finished gracefully (a dynamic jump to address `0xffff0000` was made)
        halt
    },

    -- (the "ω′" from the paper)
    -- the expected values of each of the 13 registers *after* the test program is executed
    expected-regs SEQUENCE (SIZE(13..13)) OF U32,

    -- (the "ı′" from the paper)
    -- the final value of the program counter, after the execution finishes
    expected-pc U32,

    -- (part of the "µ′" from the paper)
    -- lists all non-zero values after the execution finishes; all accessible address not on this list must be filled with zeroes
    expected-memory MemoryChunk
}
