//! This module defines an explicit casting facility to replace Rust's built-in `as` casts.
//! The general idea is:
//!   * Casts should be usable everywhere, including in `const fn`s (which means we can't use traits).
//!   * Casts should fail to compile if a) the source or the target type changes, and b) the cast between the new pair of types would now be incorrect.
//!   * `usize` is assumed to be always at least 32-bit.
